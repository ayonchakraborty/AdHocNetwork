NOTES:
This is a skeleton application meant for exchanging data in between nodes in an 
adhoc network and logging them into files. The following steps describes how to 
run the code, with necessary prerequisites.

1. First of all, you need a Linux machine equipped with a wireless interface. In the 
    console, type "iwlist" and check whether the command is supported. If not, install
    wireless-tools in your machine by, "sudo apt-get install wireless-tools" and proceed.
    After you are done, recheck "iwlist" command. The other handy tools available in the
    wireless-tools package are at, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_tools_for_Linux
     "$> iwlist interface scanning" will scan the network interface and give you the list
   of available access points that can be sensed. This along with the signal strength 
   information gives you the approximate location of your node (laptop).

2. Now we will set up the ad-hoc network.
    a) Go to Network Connections -> Edit connections -> Wireless
    b) 'Add' a connection 
              Connection Name and SSID: CSE570_XX (where XX will be determined by your adhoc network group)
              Mode: Ad-hoc (leave the rest)
              Wireless security: None
              IPv4 Settings: Shared to other computers
              Ignore IPv6 settings 
    c) Having set up the ad-hoc network, try to connect to it. Go to the Network connections
        and connect to the network CSE570_XX. If you cannot see it in the list, see
        'connect to hidden wireless networks'. Make sure you successfully connect to it.
         Now, test it on your peer's machine. Once you set up the network CSE570_XX, you
        should be able to view that ad-hoc network from your peer's machine. Connect to it.
   d) Check your network addresses. Do a ifconfig, and check out your own ip and the 
        broadcast address. Broadcast address means if anybody *who is connected to the
        network CSE570_XX* sends out a packet to the bcast ip, every node in that network
        hears it. You require the bcast address for this application.

3. Now we have the system ready. Set up a network and run the application.

    [A]-----------[B]---------------------------------[C]
                   |
                   |
                  [D]-----------------[E]

    The above shows a sample instance of the ad-hoc network you would be running.
    Suppose B sets up the network and the others connect to it. For all nodes,A,B,C,D,E
    the broadcast address would be the same. 
    Compile and run the source code provided to you. 
    If your wireless interface is known as wlan, you should run the code like the following,
    :\> ./a.out  10.42.43.255 wlan
  
   Three files would be created in the local directory in the local directory from where you are
   running the application. Check out the source code for more details.
